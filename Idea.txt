Main idea:

    Develop an AI model that is able to drive a car round a track

Development:

    1. Make the car take the optimal racing line
    2. This can be developed to have 'power ups' and possibly compete against other cars on the same track (compare against
    different path finding algorithms/random agent)
    3. Test it on different circuits
